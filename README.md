# Jquery-Salary-Calculator

## Description
Duration: Weekend

    This application is for a user to keep track of employees and monthly budget.  It allows the user to input the employees first and last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary.  It assumes $20,000 is the monthly alloted budget and informs the user if the they have gone over that budget.  It also allows the user to delete the inputed employee (off of Employee ID) and properly tracks that current budget after the employee is deleted.
